# cloud settings should be put in this file instead of application.yml
# the reason being bootstrap.yml/.properties file is loaded BEFORE application.yml/.properties file.
#
# bootstrap.yml/.properties file is used/needed when using Spring Cloud to fetch application's configuration
# that is stored on a remote configuration server (e.g. Spring Cloud Config Server).
#
# The official document says:
# A Spring Cloud application operates by creating a "bootstrap" context, which is a parent context
# for the main application. Out of the box it is responsible for loading configuration properties
# from the external sources, and also decrypting properties in the local external configuration files.
#
# the cloud related config typically contains two properties
# - spring.cloud.config.uri  -> location of the configuration server
# - spring.application.name  -> name of the application
#
# Upon startup, Spring Cloud client application makes an HTTP call to the config server with the name of the
# application and retrieves back that application's configuration.
#
# application.yml/.properties contains standard application configuration - typically default configuration
# since any configuration retrieved during the bootstrap process will override configuration defined in that file.
#

spring.application.name=hello-client

# For the application name above, the client looks at a-bootiful-client.properties present in Spring Cloud
# Config server
#spring.cloud.config.uri
